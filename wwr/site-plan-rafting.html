    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>[The purpose of our website is to share information with the community of
        people who enjoy adventure on the river's currents. Rafting in a safe
        and professional way, enjoying the pleasures of nature combined with a
        physical activity that stimulates the whole body and mind. We use the
        classification system used by the International Rafting Federation (IRF)
        which is standard around the world. He takes into account that rivers
        vary in flow and behavior. All rapids must be inspected prior to descent
        and we share best practices for this activity. We also have the entire
        line of products, from clothing to technical material needed to practice
        this sport.]</p>
