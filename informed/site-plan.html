      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>[The purpose of our website is to share information about patient health screenings with the medical community. Facilitating both the patient who does not need to take all the exams and the doctors who can view the exams safely and professionally, respecting data security. For this we use super modern technology that helps doctors to be able to make a diagnosis or prescribe exams with more precision. Information is provided chronologically, forming a base with all patient histories.]</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>[Our target audience is physicians who want to have patient exam information quickly and securely. And patients who want to have their exam base registered for future consultations. One of the great advantages is that we will have the entire history of the patients in chronological form.]</p>  <!-- change this -->
