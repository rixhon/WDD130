        <p>
          Hello Guys! Let me introduce myself. My name is Michael Franz Rixhon
          Jr.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in Brazil in a city in the mountains called Petr√≥polis, this
          city is near to Rio the Janeiro City 
        </p>

        <p>
          I am not yet a member from the church, but I follow my wife and my
          daughter in all the Church activities (they were born in the church).<br>
          I am reading Book of Mormon and I know when my time has come I will be
          baptized.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like nature, sports, seafood, diving and I like to swim every day.
          When It is possible, I like to swim in the sea.
        </p>

        <p>
          I am a designer for a long time and I migrate this knowledge to the
          web and I did many websites using CMS tools. <br>
          Now I work with project management in an IT company using Scrum methodology.
          I like technology and I want to know more about the codes behind the Webpages.
        </p>

        <p>I welcome getting to know all my classmates.</p>
        <p>Thank you for looking at my web page.</p>
